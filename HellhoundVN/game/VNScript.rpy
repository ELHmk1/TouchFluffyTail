    "Professor" "...and that is how -1/12 ends up being the sum of all positive integers."
	"If I didn't just watch him do the proof for it, I'd call him a liar."
	"But there it is on the board: -1/12."
	"My mixture of confusion and astonishment seems to be shared throughout the class."
	"Even the Anubis in the front row is holding her head in her hands as if she's going through an existential crisis."
	"Luckily for all of our sanity levels, we've finally reached the end of the period."
	"Professor" "For homework I want you to do problems 4, 8, 13..."
	"He writes our homework up on the board then dismisses us."
	"I waste no time in gathering up my things and beelining for the door."
	"After all, Fia's waiting for me."

	"As expected, I find my Hellhound girlfriend leaning against the cinderblock wall outside of the lecture hall."
	"Her classes end about an hour before mine but she likes to wait on campus for me so we can walk home together."
	"Upon seeing me, her eyes light up and her tail wriggles behind her."
	f "Well you look like you've seen a ghost."
	"A ghost floating by in the hallway glares at her, causing Fia to scramble to fix her faux pas."
